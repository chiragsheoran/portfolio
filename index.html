      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        My name is Chirag Sheoran and I'm a 22 year old curiosity driven engineer.<br>I love learning and creating. Although
        I'm a civil engineer, I've made it a point to expand my scope beyond my branch.<br>Ever since I was a kid, normal toys just didn't 
        cut it. So I resorted to making my own out of cardboard.<br>I discovered Arduino when I joined college and it unlocked a new dimension. 
        That's when I started integrating neopixels, sound sensors, heartbeat sensors, micro servos into my projects.

        Image and Video Editing using softwares like Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator, Boujou(Camera Tracker) and Cinema 4D(3D Modelling).<br>
        I am now learning Penetration Testing with Kali Linux for an OSCP Certification along with Network Engineering - both sides of the cybersecurity spectrum.<br>
        From 2009 to 2016 (Grade VI to XII) I studied in Navy Children School Port Blair.<br>From 2006-2009 (Grade III to V)

      <h2>WHY HIRE ME?</h2>
      <p>
        I am an intrinsically motivated fast learner and work to the best of my abilities. I made this portfolio in less than 48 hours
        with absolutely no initial knowledge of Web Development.<br>I respect what Sagar Defence stands for and I'm prepared to work under pressure. I apy attention to 
        detail and do not let emotion get the better of me.<br> I've always spent more time in labs, experimenting, learning, creating things. I'm positive I'd make a 
        good addition to the team.
